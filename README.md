# Bitcoin price forecast with Prophet

In this Jupyter nootebook I'm using the [GEMINI](https://www.gemini.com/eu) API to get Bitcoin data every minute. I save the data in several csv files and create a dataframe out of it. To forecast the Bitcoin price I use the [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) model and train it with the data from the Gemini API.

This is not a financial advice
